It is still compatible with PHP 4.\r\n\r\n### Magic packed in a phar, phar away...\r\nJust download phar, include it and use as much as you want.\r\n\r\n### More details\r\nBeatrix can:\r\n\r\n- smooth corners of old `iblock` queries API, avoiding lots of surprises, i.e. pagination tuning (yes, Bootstrap is already included)\r\n- unify templating using modern and flexible Plates engine, no more header-footer sawing\r\n- make you forget about awful urlrewrite.php crutch. Handle urlrewriting at any depth with any rules possible at Slim 2 routing\r\n- crop images with Image lib, fr more powerful than `ResizeImageGet()`.\r\n- run at PHP 5.3+ environments","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
