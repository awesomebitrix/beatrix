# Beatrix templates

Different internal templates that used inside of Beatrix for rendering pagination, for example.

`Beatrix::view()` engine has registered 'beatrix::' alias for this directory. 
But any template can be overriden using `<yourTemplatesDir>/beatrix` dir. 

Just put there template with same name and it will be overriden.
